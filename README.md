## I'm gonna rock THREE.JS and it's helper libraries, check this out!

**Plan:** Different branch for different functionalities so I don't have to comment out imports and components. ðŸ˜‚

So, basically, I'm gonna go through the following https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples examples and try to write one by one and see why I fail. ðŸ˜‚

That's all.
